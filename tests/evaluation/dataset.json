    "question": "What is the main advantage of using a hybrid retrieval approach in RAG?",
    "contexts": [
      "Vector search is excellent for finding semantically similar content, but it can miss explicit connections. Graph-based retrieval excels at traversing known relationships. A hybrid model combines the strengths of both, using vector search for semantic relevance and graph search for contextual, factual precision.",
      "Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is a technique used to combine results from different retrieval systems. It provides a robust way to merge ranked lists by prioritizing documents that appear high up in multiple lists."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "The main advantage of a hybrid retrieval approach is that it combines the semantic relevance capabilities of vector search with the contextual and factual precision of graph-based retrieval, leveraging the strengths of both methods."
